- How to run your program: 	I have made the program in x64, Visual Studio 2019.

- How to use your program: 	Execute normally, there are no inputs/controls.
				The program prints the outputs of the tests automatically.

- Important parts of the code: 	The operators and constructors of any of the classes were helpful to
				build those functions for the rest.
